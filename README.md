# Cellfinder-visualize User Guide

## About

`cellfinder-visualize` is a tool for post-cellfinder data visualisation and analysis.
The core aims are to provide:

 - Publication quality visualisations of cellfinder experiments for multiple samples
 - Standardised publication quality plots of cell counts for different region sets
   - Easy toggling of regions of interest
   - Matching visualisations to quantifications
   - Lateralised views
   - Slice views
 - Statistical analysis  (in progress)


`cellfinder-visualize` is a tool developed by [Stephen Lenzi](https://github.com/stephenlenzi) in the [Margrie Lab](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/groups/margrie-lab), generously supported by the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/).

## Installation


```conda create -n  cellfinder-visualize python```

```conda activate  cellfinder-visualize```

```git clone https://github.com/brainglobe/cellfinder-visualize.git```

```cd cellfinder-visualize```

```pip install -e .```

## Usage

Simply run from the commandline as follows

```conda activate  cellfinder-visualize```

```cellfinder_visualize```

This will open a GUI for selecting parameters

```experiment dir``` should be a directory containing cellfinder output directories. When selected, all subfolders in the selected directory will be displayed and available in the ```experiment group``` section in the GUI where they can be selected and assigned a group for running through the analysis.

```experiment group``` sample directories shown under experiment group can be selected and assigned to groups for comparative analysis.

```Set Group A``` when clicked, this button will assign all currently highlighted directories to a single experimental group (group A) for analysis.

```Set Group B``` when clicked, this button will assign all currently highlighted directories to a single experimental group (group B) for analysis.

```output dir``` should be a directory for saving any outputs for your sample

```Save Settings``` when clicked, this button will save the current selected settings to a file called settings.pkl in the output directory that can be loaded again later.

```config``` select a previously saved settings.pkl file to load previous settings into the GUI.

```coronal slice start``` if you want to show only a coronal subsection this value is the start in microns

```coronal slice end``` if you want to show only a coronal subsection this value is the end of that section in microns

```root``` if checked the whole brain outline will be shown

```show reference structures``` if checked, several brain regions will be added for reference only

```filter cells by structure``` if checked, cells displayed will be restricted to the regions listed in ```region list```

```hemisphere``` whether to display and count cells in left/right/both hemispheres

```slice root``` if checked, and a subregion is selected (e.g. only one hemisphere, or a coronal section) then all other unselected regions will not be visible

```subsample factor``` show every nth cell of the number chosen

```highlight subregion``` outlines will be drawn for subregions that contain the string in this box. i.e. if you wanted to highlight layer 5 in displayed regions, then ```5``` would achieve this.

```region list``` each item in this list will be displayed and included in any analysis

```colors``` color labels that each correspond to items in the region list.

```reference region``` the region used to normalise cell counts to.

```brainrender``` if checked, brainrender will run.

```barplots``` if checked, barplots will be generated of the cell counts.

```load additional obj files``` if any .obj files are present in the directory given then they will be rendered in the brainrender view.

```camera pos``` position of the camera in brainrender.

```camera viewup``` the camera "up" direction for brainrender.

```camera clipping range``` the range of clipping the brainrender image.

```shader style``` the shader option to be used in brainrender.





The end result should be bar plots per sample indicating the counts and percentages of cells in each region:

And also a pooled plot indicating the averages for all samples and the individual points:

A boxplot of each experimental group:

Together with a brainrender of the samples and target regions:

Any .obj files in the directory hierarchy will be automatically displayed e.g.:
